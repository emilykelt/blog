    <p>Being basically isolated in Birmingham for my internship, I found myself travelling the country in order to visit friends interning elsewhere. This weekend, i had the pleasure of visiting my friends doing a UROP (research placement), who were staying in college. 
Of course I wanted to visit them! Other Pemscis! 2 out of us 4 first years were working in Cambridge, so me and Matt went to visit. 
Part of the appeal was also being able to visit Cambridge, which has come to feel like home to me over the year. Being able to visit without the academic pressure was so peaceful (despite it being horribly humid weather). 
Other compscis staying in Cambridge all met up — so on the Friday after work I travelled down (3 cancelled services, thanks cross country)— just in time to see them. 
We spent the day cooking, hanging out, and exploring what will be our next year accommodation. 2 sellys. Which does have the reputation of being the ‘party house’, so we will see how that one goes next year I suppose…
As the trains in this country are horribly unreliable and expensive, I begged my manager if I could take Monday as remote work, allowing me to take the cheaper and faster train down on monday evening (alas, signalling issues did not make the ‘quicker’ much use). 
So after spending a lovely weekend with pemscis, and meeting up with a few other friends who happened to be in Cambridge, it was Monday.
I worked remotely from a desolate plib. It felt reminiscent of those weeks at the end of exam season when it was just us first year pemscis, abandoned by everyone else, in between the shelves. 
I changed my scenery plenty however, not wanting to be sat down for too long. Cafe 84 was visited again, it now seems to have an extensive food menu! However, I had been to ‘trough’ already with Bea and Ari: paneer curry, but the paneer was slightly charred :( 
For my meeting, an extended stand-up, I took it in an empty pem bar (or the Old Lodge I think it’s officially called). Then, the rain decided to stop the minute my meeting concluded, so the table in the garden called my name. Working in nature, hearing the bird songs, with a warm, slight breeze, is honestly ideal for me. Very relaxing. However, perhaps too relaxing, so I migrated to plaw lib (pembroke law library) - and worked there for a bit. 
The problem with working on large extensive codebases is that if you need to do a clean rebuild, it can take forever. I was 10% of the way through 10 minutes in. So I decided to browse the computer science books, out of curiosity.
I ended up taking 4 home with me for the summer (despite having a backpack so heavy I could barely carry it anyways). And without a proper phone charger to plug into the train while it was at a standstill, and my phone slowly draining, I sat down to read a book. The shortest one was ‘Oversharing’ by Ben Agger, which although taken from the computer science section, seems to have a very heavy focus on sociology. 
Which, I’m not complaining about. I’m the sort of person to be basically interested in any field (provided there is some ‘hook’ for my curiosity to catch on to). 
It reads like it is from the perspective one’s grandpa might take, and to a person who admittedly is chronically online, it feels like a lecture shaming us all for our tendencies. I was quick to realise it was written in 2012. So although from a time where social media isn’t quite so prevalent in everyday life (mainly referring to short tweets and facebook posts), many of the points are still valid today. 
It seems to be quick to blame oversharing on the ‘twitterification’ and ‘instantaneity’ of social media. Then seems to accuse people who overshare as narcissistic. Which, to some extent, I agree with. Many reasons for posting on social media ARE, I feel, to do with low self esteem and a need to prove one is as great as one thinks they are, or at least to pretend. Hiding intimacy behind a screen is easier, so is constructing the ideal self image. It is easier to exaggerate or to omit certain details when the connection on social media is superficial by nature. 
I do think the argument ignores a few details. Which may not have been as apparent at the time, or as obvious for someone who doesn’t post as much. I don’t feel as if the definition of what ‘oversharing’ is, is clarified enough. The book draws upon examples of ‘oversharing’ as divulging one’s relationship status on facebook. However, in a physical social network, you would likely share this information regardless, or it would be told through a chain of gossip. Marriage rings are not seen as oversharing, so it is my belief that if somebody wants to express themselves in such a way, then they should be able to use the platform of social media to do as much. 
The circle that the information could reach is wider yes, as you do have many more friends on facebook on average than you do in real life, however, the reach of an offline social circle can share information to the same extent. You are able to ‘overshare’ in real life: and the information may be spread around and heard by the same people that would have viewed the Facebook post. Social media just prevents another platform for ‘oversharing’. And yes, there may be the tendency to post more often, and more irrelevant details as you crave a connection, but if you were the type of person to overshare on social media, then you would almost certainly do the same in person. 
Social media does create more of a need to be ‘seen’, especially if you are a woman. I don’t know if it is because of something like similarity bias, but I see a significant amount of women my age posting than I do men. I have felt socially pressured to post pictures of myself, to fit in, and be seen. 
However this pressure cultivated by my peers from an early age has grown into something more healthy, as I will discuss later. 
I haven’t finished the book at the time of writing so I don’t know if I am just going on a tangent or if I am hitting the same points as the author, but this desire to ‘be seen’ has many people living their lives performatively. Choosing which restaurant to visit next based purely on if it will make a good story post rather than the items taste. But we are visual creatures, influenced by our environments and the designs around us. I wonder to what extent I would be in search of beautiful things if I knew there was no opportunity to post them? Would an artist still appreciate a rose if it could not be preserved in paint and displayed in a gallery for many to see? I would argue that on one hand, posting beautiful places can be seen as a way to ‘exaggerate’ and shape your personality to make it more appealing, but on the other hand, could be an appreciation for the beauty around us. Like many things I believe it exists on a scale. If the only things you are posting, that you find ‘beautiful’ or some other quality, are of frivolous expensive purchases, yachts, and hedonistic parties, then it perhaps leans into the narcissistic tendency to ‘overshare’. You may be sharing these pictures to portray your wealth, exaggerating it by cherry picking select moments in order to shape your image. What you post on social media reflects your priorities. You could call this into question, because while it may reflect your life, what do you gain by posting it? A picture of a well placed designer bag in an expensive restaurant is more of a ‘Look at me’. However, if your lifestyle happens to involve these bags and restaurants, then perhaps you would feel less of a need to post it? You may feel inclined to post something else: such as a feature of the architecture. 
I could make the comparison here of ‘loud logos’ and ‘quiet luxury’, loud logos want to be seen, they want to prove to someone that the wearer has the means to be able to afford it. Nobody, without influencing, is naturally drawn to these logos. (I have not looked into this scientifically - it is just a general observation). Loud logos are even seen as tacky. A desperation to be seen as wealthy. Getting a fake designer bag and ‘oversharing’ on social media may have the same goal in mind: to shape a person’s image in a particular way, make them seem more wealthy than they actually are, as that is the image they want to portray. I don’t necessarily think this is always out of narcissism. Maybe in the case of appearing wealthy, or trying to seem better, but portraying yourself in a certain way isn’t always narcissistic. Any post on social media is the portrayal of a certain image. 
The book is in favour of what seems to be a free-speech, platform of academic discourse. While this would be great in theory, and oh boy would it be lovely, this is definitely a sub group already on the internet (what’s great about the internet is you can basically find a community of people anywhere), and in interacting with posts in that way, you also portray a certain image of yourself. Even by not posting anything, you portray something about yourself. Part of society is the portrayal of self, you cannot avoid it. You walk out the street, and people are free to judge you. Just as you can post something on social media. Your choices of where you go, and who you let follow you are indicative of how much you want to be perceived. 
So while having an empty profile doesn’t necessarily mean you are oversharing, the question is, what does oversharing actually constitute? I feel like it is a murky area, where definitions vary depending on who you ask. 
There is a difference between sharing something because you are genuinely excited about it, versus sharing something seeking validation. 
Social media already has a lot of ‘boxes’, niches, ‘aesthetics’ that people are segregated into, so I know it is definitely significantly more complicated than validation vs passion and I don’t want to reduce the motivations for posting into vague descriptors. Unlike what this book is arguing, most people share to ‘connect’ with people, not just have meaningless interactions to pass the time. 
My argument is that social media is a canvas for creativity and expression. If you cultivate your photos and portray yourself in a certain way, you are likely to find like-minded people. 
I like using my social media in a specific way, posting a few things indicative of my interests (maybe a picture abroad in the mountains, a cup of tea in a library), breadcrumbs to people I may not know well as to if they would get along with me. I have found my social media an outlet of creativity, and a means to connect and stay in touch with people. 
The book is under the assumption that there is either ‘share or don’t’ but today’s social media has many different layers. On instagram, I can choose to post something to my ‘close friends’ — people I know well. And while it is a quick update, perhaps a low effort means of trying to validate something about myself, it is also an easy way to keep in touch. I can post slightly more personal things there, so I do not ‘overshare’ with everyone I am friends with. Not everybody needs to know for example that I am back in Cambridge working from home. Some people simply don’t care. People don’t need to know. And yet, through this, one of my friends was able to know that I would be in Cambridge when he wouldn’t have known otherwise. Like yes, I would have messaged people individually to ask if they were in Cambridge at that time (and I did, for those that I knew might be), but sometimes there are chance encounters only able to be engineered through social media. And these layers of privacy mean that I can filter out the people who I would happily call for hours from the people I would just say hi to. 
And yes, while a call is much better, I find myself investing the same amount of emotional commitment into my text messages. For my generation, it is literally just another way to express myself. It may be easier to overshare while hiding behind a screen as the book argues, I would also say all of the same things in person.
I do agree with the majority of the takeaways of the book, I am just sharing some of my thoughts that I had while reading, coming from a different perspective and time period.  I won’t deny that the rise of social media has led to an abundance of information readily available at your fingertips — but it is not much different in terms of the connections and interactions that could be made by example, from living in college. 
By living near another person you are likely to bump into them, and gradually get to know them better (i.e. in social media terms, be included in more ‘tiers’ of story sharing) through forced proximity. Social media just makes that proximity much closer, which while it has its downsides, has opened up many new channels for expression and connection. 
Now, in defence of the instagram photo dump. This usually consists of an account linked to your main personal page, with significantly fewer friends, and an increased quantity of posts. If you get to know someone better you can see more of their life. It doesn’t necessarily reduce the capacity for meaningful conversation, I would argue it could also expand it as there are more opportunities for seeking connection. My account was created in 2021, and since then, has served as a host to a gallery of nostalgia. I have over 20K photos in my photo album, but by cherry picking ones for my photo dump account, I’ve selected what I think means the most to me. It’s like a public visual counterpart to my diary. Sometimes I catch myself scrolling back to the beginning of the account. I definitely have more than 100 post now, each with around 10 photos on average. But I can see my progression as I grew up over the years, posting pictures I thought represented me or the things I was doing. Something I wouldn’t have had without it. And knowing that it will be seen by my close friends has allowed me to curate it with an element of freedom. Knowing that they know who I am, and won’t judge me. I can see myself following trends in 2021, growing older and becoming more individualistic. 
There could be an element of narcissism to posting on social media, but this could also transfer to narcissism in hanging a portrait in an art gallery or wearing an outfit you are particularly proud of. Posting is an expression of creativity, as long as you do not become obsessed with your self image, and do things for the ‘gram. Oversharing is a delicate spectrum, and there is art in what to share and what to keep to yourself. 
I’m nostalgic for my past, and I want my friends to experience my joy as well.</p>
